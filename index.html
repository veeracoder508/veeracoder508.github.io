                            Welcome to the Adyar Eco Park, a restored slice of the historic Coromandel Coast right in Chennai. This is a guide to the fragile estuary ecosystem, where river water meets the Bay of Bengal, nurturing unique mangroves and migratory birds. Discover how the city's lungs were brought back to life, acting as a crucial defense against floods and a centre for environmental education.

                        <p class="description">
                            The Adyar Creek is a narrow backwater of the Adyar River before it meets the Bay of Bengal, forming a crucial estuary. This area is defined by its mix of freshwater and saltwater, creating a unique brackish environment that supports life specially adapted to constant salinity changes.

                            The Adyar Eco Park is a symbol of successful restoration and must be treated with respect. Its fragile ecosystem requires minimal human impact to thrive.<br>

                        <p class="description"><br>
                            Visitor Guidelines:<br>

Timing is Key: Visit early morning (6:00 AM - 9:00 AM) for the best chance to spot diverse birdlife.<br><br>

No Littering: Use designated bins only. Do not introduce any plastic or foreign material into the water or plants.<br><br>

Photography: Simple, non-commercial photography is permitted. Avoid using flash near wildlife, especially birds.<br><br>

The Big Threat: Pollution remains a continuous challenge. Support efforts to monitor and stop sewage discharge into the Adyar River upstream.
