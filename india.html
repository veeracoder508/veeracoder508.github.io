            <h1>Education polices by the India government</h1>
            <p class="par">In India, education is governed by a mix of constitutional provisions, acts of parliament, and national policies.<br> 
                Key legislation includes the <span>of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 (RTE Act)</span>, which makes education a fundamental right for children aged 6-14 and outlines provisions for free and compulsory education.<br> 
                Additionally, the Constitution itself, through <span>Article 21A</span>, guarantees this right. </p>
