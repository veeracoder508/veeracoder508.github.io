            <h1>Education policies by the UN</h1>
            <p class="par"> <span>Article 26 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights</span> states that “Everyone has the right to education.”<br> 
                Today however, 57 million children remain out of school. Education is not only a right,<br>
                but a passport to human development that opens doors and expands opportunities and freedoms.<br> 
                <span>Development Goal 4: Ensuring Inclusive, Equitable, and Quality Education and the Promotion of<br>
                Lifelong Learning Opportunities for All</span>, recognizes several impediments for universal education and attempts to<br> 
                address them through targets to increase the number of scholarships to students in developing nations and create educational<br> 
                facilities that are gender sensitive and disability inclusive.
